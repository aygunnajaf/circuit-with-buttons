# circuit-with-buttons
arduino project
used 6 jumper wires, LED, 2pushbuttons, 3 resistors( a 330 ohm and 2 of them are 10k ohm), breadboard and Arduino.
l placed pushbuttons on the gap of breadboard and above legs connected with 5V, below legs connected pin2, pin3.
10k ohm resistors connected with gnd and below legs
one wire connected gnds on the arduino and breadboard.
LED connected with gnd on the breadboard and resistor with 330 ohm which connected pin13.
